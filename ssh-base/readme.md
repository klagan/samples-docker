# Getting started

This sample shows how to create a base for a `Dockerfile` that allows SSH connections for `Azure Web Apps`.

You can read about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?pivots=container-linux#deploy-the-image-and-test-the-app)

This sample starts up an apache webserver as an **example**.  Replace the installation of `apache` and the start up of apache for whatever the docker image is supposed to do.

The reason they are in this set up is because the sample had to do something.
